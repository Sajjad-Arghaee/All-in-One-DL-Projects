Arthur Blake, the lighthouse keeper, stood at the top of the tower, his eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of ships in distress. The beam of the lighthouse cut through the mist, sweeping over the dark waters below, but there was nothing—just the endless fog.\\n\\nArthur had spent decades in this lighthouse, guiding ships safely through the treacherous waters, but tonight, something felt different. There was an eerie stillness in the air, and the fog seemed...alive, shifting and swirling as if it had a mind of its own.\\n\\nThen, out of the corner of his eye, he saw them—shadowy figures moving through the fog, barely visible but unmistakable. They were tall, gaunt, their forms flickering in and out of sight as the fog ebbed and flowed around them.\\n\\nArthur’s pulse quickened. He had heard the stories, the old legends about the ghostly figures that haunted the cliffs, appearing only when the fog was thickest. But he had never believed them—until now.\\n\\nHe grabbed his binoculars, focusing on the figures. They were moving slowly, deliberately, making their way toward the lighthouse. His heart pounded as he watched them approach, their outlines growing clearer with each passing second. Were they lost sailors? Something worse?\\n\\nArthur rushed down the spiral staircase and out into the cold night air, his flashlight cutting through the dense fog. The figures were closer now, almost at the base of the lighthouse. He called out, but his voice was swallowed by the mist. His hands trembled as he neared them.\\n\\nBut when he finally reached the spot where he had seen the figures, there was nothing. Just fog and the jagged rocks along the shoreline. His flashlight flickered, casting eerie shadows that danced along the ground. Had he imagined it? \\n\\nJust as he was about to turn back, he heard it—whispers. Faint, like the wind, but unmistakably voices. And then, from behind him, a cold hand grabbed his shoulder.'}\n"

    "**Overview**\n",
    "Semantic similarity is a measure of the closeness in meaning between textual data points. By evaluating the semantic similarity, we can determine how closely related sentences or texts are based on their contextual meanings. This technique is crucial in tasks like natural language understanding, text clustering, and summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentence Embedding Models**\n",
    "Sentence embedding models, such as the SentenceTransformer models, are designed to convert textual data into fixed-length numerical vectors. These vectors represent the semantic meaning of the input text and enable similarity computations in a high-dimensional vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cosine Similarity**\n",
    "Cosine similarity is a metric used to calculate the similarity between two vectors. It measures the cosine of the angle between them, providing a value between –0 and 1– where 1 indicates identical orientation (high similarity), and 0 represents orthogonality (no similarity).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps for Evaluation**\n",
    "1. **Embedding Generation**:\n",
    "   - Convert input texts into numerical embeddings using a pre-trained sentence embedding model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Similarity Computation**:\n",
    "   - Calculate pairwise cosine similarity between consecutive sentence embeddings.\n",
    "   - Aggregate the results to compute an average similarity score.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Applications**:\n",
    "   - Assessing coherence in generated text.\n",
    "   - Comparing thematic consistency across textual segments.\n",
    "   - Measuring logical flow in narrative structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case Example**\n",
    "Given a set of sentences, evaluate their semantic coherence using the above methodology. Generate embeddings for the sentences and compute the pairwise similarity between them. An average similarity score provides insights into the overall semantic alignment within the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**\n",
    "The final output includes an average semantic similarity score representing the coherence level of the input sentences. This metric can serve as a quantitative benchmark for tasks requiring textual coherence analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications and Importance**\n",
    "- Ensuring high-quality text generation in AI systems.\n",
    "- Improving readability and comprehension in machine-translated text.\n",
    "- Identifying thematic transitions in large-scale documents.\n",

    "# Investigating the Effect of Early Stopping on Model Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:**\n",
    "This investigation explores how the use of early stopping impacts model performance in terms of diversity, fluency, and coherence in generated text. Early stopping halts training when the model performance on validation data stops improving, preventing overfitting and reducing unnecessary computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Model and Tokenizer Setup:**\n",
    "- **Loaded Pre-trained GPT-2 Model and Tokenizer:**\n",
    "  - Utilized the `GPT2LMHeadModel` and `GPT2Tokenizer` from the Hugging Face library.\n",
    "  - Adjusted configurations, such as setting the pad token to match the end-of-sequence token.\n",
    "- **Configured Device Placement:**\n",
    "  - Moved the model to GPU for efficient training if available.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Dataset Preparation:**\n",
    "- **Tokenization:**\n",
    "  - Tokenized the dataset using a function to process the `output` column while truncating/padding to a maximum length of 512 tokens.\n",
    "  - Removed unnecessary columns (`instruction` and `input`) to simplify the dataset.\n",
    "- **Adding Labels:**\n",
    "  - Created a `labels` field identical to the `input_ids` for loss computation during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Defining Training Arguments:**\n",
    "- Configured the following parameters:\n",
    "  - Learning rate: `5e-5`\n",
    "  - Batch size: `4`\n",
    "  - Number of epochs: `3`\n",
    "  - Save and evaluation strategy: End of each epoch.\n",
    "  - `load_best_model_at_end`: Enabled to retain the best model checkpoint.\n",
    "  - Integrated early stopping with a patience of 2 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Trainer Initialization and Training:**\n",
    "- **Trainer Setup:**\n",
    "  - Used the Hugging Face `Trainer` class, passing the model, training arguments, datasets, and early stopping callback.\n",
    "- **Training Results:**\n",
    "  - Achieved steady improvement across epochs with the following validation losses:\n",
    "    - Epoch 1: `2.255391`\n",
    "    - Epoch 2: `2.202449`\n",
    "    - Epoch 3: `2.190252`\n",
    "  - Early stopping ensured no unnecessary training beyond convergence.\n",
    "  - we know that the loss per epoch was as below in the normal model:\n",
    "    - Epoch 1: `2.180239 `\n",
    "    - Epoch 2: `2.169151`\n",
    "    - Epoch 3: `2.167197`\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The worse validation loss is maybe because of a different initialization of the model and it's not related to Early Stopping! In common, Early Stopping helps to reduce the epoch numbers and computations. Here we only had 3 number of epochs, so there is no expectation of model to be converged in below 3 epochs.\n",
